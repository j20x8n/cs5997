Bonus Assignment: A case study on working fluid selection for a geothermal plant 
Instructions: 
• Answer the provided questions and provide your answers in a report format. 
• Fluid property evaluation: You may use the link to the website provided below to obtain   the   properties of   various   working fluids.   You   will have   to download a small thermodynamic   state calculator to compute the properties of   various fluids. The interface of   the application   is very user friendly.
• Thermo-State Application (Free): https://thermo-state.github.io/
Case Study: 
You      are      tasked      with      the      planning      and      design      of    a       50       MW       geothermal      power      plant.A   schematic   of   the   geothermal   plant   is   shown   in   the   figure   below.   A   geothermal   powerplant   uses the thermal energy of   the hot rocks below the earth’s   surface   to   heat   the working   fluid.   Boreholes   are drilled several   kilometers into   the earth’s surface   to   reach the   hot rocks.   Next a suitable   working   fluid is pumped through the   boreholes and is heated at high pressure   by a heat exchanger (“boiler”)   near the   hot   rocks   below   the   ground   level.   Finally,   the   heated   working   fluid   is passed   through   a   power   cycle   of   choice   to   generate   electricity.The   ambient   temperature   at   the   ground   level,   TC    is   30   。C.   The   temperature   beneath   the   surface   increases   at   a   rate   of   25   。C/km   of   depth   into   the   lithosphere.   You   would   like   the   maximum   temperature of   your cycle, TH, to be at   least   200 。C.
a.       Determine the depth,H, in km, of   drilling needed   to   reach   a   TH    of   200 。C. (2 pts)
b.   代 写ENG 105 ThermodynamicsSQL
代做程序编程语言    Calculate   the   maximum   thermal   efficiency   that   your   powerplant   can   achieve. (3 pts)You   have   decided   to   use   a   Rankine   cycle   to   design   the   power   cycle   for   your   geothermal   plant.   Your next task will be to   make   a   decision   on   the   working   fluid   for   the   power   cycle.   Three   fluids   are being considered namely:
1.         Water
2.       Ammonia
3.         R22For each fluid, the boiler’s operating pressure   should   be   such   that   the   vapor   quality   at   the   turbine   exit   is   at least   88%. Assume the turbine   and pump are   isentropic,   and the   working   fluid   is   heated   to a temperature of   TH    at the boiler exit.
c.       Determine the operating pressure in the boiler of   the cycle   for   each   fluid   (10 pts)
d.       Determine the   state of   the fluid at   the   turbine   inlet   and   draw   the   T-s   diagram   of   the power   cycle   for   each   ofthe   working   fluids.   (5 pts)
e.       Calculate the thermal efficiencies provided by each   fluid   (20 pts)
f.         Evaluate the mass of   working fluid required for each fluid to   generate   a   power   of   50   MW.   (5 pts)
g.       Compare the densities of   the working fluids at the turbine inlet and outlet and comment on   how the densities and total volume of   the working fluids at these locations may affect your   decision in selecting a working   fluid.   (5 pts)
Report 
h.       Present your results from the above analysis in a report no longer than 3 pages highlighting relevant information and   how   you arrive at your selection decision. In addition   to   efficiencies,   consider   external   factors   such   as   material   costs,   drilling   costs,   chemical   compatibility, etc. and reference any useful resource that helps you arrive at your decision.   (10 pts)
